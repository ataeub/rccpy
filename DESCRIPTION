Description: This package simplifies the installation of the CloudComPy python library
    (https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudComPy) to one simple command. Python scripts
    requiring CloudComPy can then easily be run using the source_ccpy() function. The
    package includes a python module called cloudcompype, which wraps some commands of
    CloudComPy commonly used in forest-science point cloud analysis in a single class
    for the easy creation of data analysis pipelines. The class can be used in the
    scripts sourced with source_ccpy() without any import, as this is done within the
    package.
